  <h1>Project Overview</h1>
  <p>This is an Electric Vehicle Analysis project conducted using Microsoft Power BI.</p>

  <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
  <p>The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprises 17 columns with a total of 150,483 records, offering comprehensive information on Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the United States. The dataset encompasses diverse features including VIN, County, City, State, Postal Code, Model Year, Make, Model, Electric Vehicle Type, Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility, Electric Range, Base MSRP, Legislative District, DOL Vehicle ID, Vehicle Location, Electric Utility, and 2020 Census Tract.</p>

  <h2>Key Findings</h2>
  <p>The analysis underscores a notable preference for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) within the market, constituting approximately 77.61% of the dataset. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) also hold significance, comprising about 22.39% of the dataset.</p>
  <p>Insights pertaining to the total vehicle count, average electric range, distribution of BEV and PHEV vehicles, correlation between electric range and car make, CAFV eligibility, and the rise of electric vehicles over time are discernible from this dashboard.</p>
